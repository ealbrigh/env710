data and code for albright's applied statistical modeling course

## Welcome to ENV710 Applied Statistical Modeling for Environmental Management


## Course Overview

This course will provide an introduction to statistical modeling, estimation, hypotheses testing and regression analysis for applied problems in the environmental social sciences, management and policy. Throughout the semester we will focus on data analytic and statistical concepts along with the interpretation and communication of results from data analysis. A major emphasis of our work will include writing literate data analysis reports and critiquing statistical analyses.

It is my belief that data analysis methods are best learned by doing and, therefore, active learning will be central to this course. In the class sessions, some of the class time will be spent working in groups on data analysis activities. For this format to be successful, you must arrive prepared for class. It is my expectation that you will complete the assigned readings (or watch videos if assigned) before the lectures and work through the suggested problems on your own before class begins. I will incorporate a number of technologies during the semester including, but not limited to, the Sakai course management system, practice problems, discussion boards and videos developed to explain and illustrate a diversity of statistical concepts.

## The Cadence of the Course

The course will meet live in person throughout the semester on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11.45am till 1pm. The first portion of each class period will be spent with Professor Albright lecturing on the key themes from the readings and reviewing any questions that students may have on the material. The second portion of most class periods will often be spent in smaller groups. In these groups, students will engage in group problem solving exercises. Lecture attendance is expected. 

Each student will also attend an R lab session (most weeks). In the lab sessions, students will work on R tutorials and lab assignments (individually or in groups). Attendance in lab sessions is required. 

Labs, either group or individual, will be due on Mondays (see Course Schedule).
